# 3D_Printing_Defects_Classification_and-_Detection
This repository contains datasets, models, and code for detecting and classifying defects in 3D-printed objects. The project is designed to identify common 3D printing issues, including stringing, spaghetti, and warping, using classification and object detection approaches.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Classification: Categorizes 3D-printed images into different defect types.
Detection: Identifies and localizes defects in 3D-printed objects using YOLOv8.
Dataset: Contains images with corresponding annotations in XML (Pascal VOC) and YOLO format.
Model Training: Uses TensorFlow and YOLOv8 for classification and detection tasks.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, YOLOv8
Frameworks: OpenCV, PyTorch
Annotation Formats: Pascal VOC (XML), YOLO
